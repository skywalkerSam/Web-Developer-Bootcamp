# Getting Started with React - ROBOFRIENDS

A simple Robofriends application made with React. This project is a part of my Web Development Bootcamp by ZTM.

- Introduction to State, Props, Functional Components & Class Components.

- Introduction to Components & Component Lifecycle.

- File Structure of a React Project.

- Using Tachyons for Styling.

- Little Tweaks for Code Readability.

- Building the Project for Production for the first time Using `npm run build`ðŸ™‚

- Updating the project to the latest version of React.   (`package.json`)

- Using `ErrorBoundry.js` Component to catch errors in the application.

- The best way to update a project is to update the package.json file manually and then run `npm install` to install the latest versions of the packages and dependencies...ðŸ™‚

- The best way to learn is to read the Documentation.ðŸ™‚
