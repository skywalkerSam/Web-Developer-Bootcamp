As you have already learned from previous videos and notebooks, API stands for Application Programming Interface and is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. \n","\n","The advantages of using APIs:\n"," *   **Automation**. Less human effort is required and workflows can be easily updated to become faster and more      \n","     productive.\n"," *   **Efficiency**. It allows to use the capabilities of one of the already developed APIs than to try to \n","     independently implement some functionality from scratch.\n"," \n","The disadvantage of using APIs:\n"," *   **Security**. If the API is poorly integrated, it means it will be vulnerable to attacks, resulting in data breeches or losses having financial or reputation implications.\n","\n","One of the applications we will use in this notebook is Random User Generator. RandomUser is an open-source, free API providing developers with randomly generated users to be used as placeholders for testing purposes. This makes the tool similar to Lorem Ipsum, but is a placeholder for people instead of text. The API can return multiple results, as well as specify generated user details such as gender, email, image, username, address, title, first and last name, and more. More information on RandomUser can be found [here](https://randomuser.me/documentation?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkPY0101ENSkillsNetwork1005-2023-01-01#intro).\n","\n","Another example of simple API we will use in this notebook is Fruitvice application. The Fruitvice API webservice which provides data for all kinds of fruit! You can use Fruityvice to find out interesting information about fruit and educate yourself. The webservice is completely free to use and contribute to.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1c4628bf-9966-4992-a408-42a1569fb1ba","metadata":{},"source":["## Example 1: RandomUser API\n","Bellow are Get Methods parameters that we can generate.
