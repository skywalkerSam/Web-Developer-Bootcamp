# Asynchronous JavaScript

JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning it has one call stack and one memory heap. As expected, it executes code in order and must finish executing a piece code before moving on to the next. This is where asynchronous JavaScript comes into play.

- Callbacks
  
- Promises

- ASYNC/AWAIT
