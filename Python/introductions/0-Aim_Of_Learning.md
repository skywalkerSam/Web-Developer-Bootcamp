# Goals for learning Python

    AI & Machine Learning.

## Pre-Basics

    Programming Language: A language to communicate with machines

    Human  ->  Programming Language   ->  Interpreter / Compiler  ->  Machine Language [Binary(0, 1)]  ->  Machine Work

    Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript (JS), Ruby, C/C++, Go, Rust etc.

    Python  ->  Interpreter  ->  cpython  ->  Machine Language / Binary
    
    That's why Python is not as fast as C or C++ ;(

    Python is much closer to english lol ;)

    C/C++  ->  Compiler  ->  Machine Language / Binary
    
    Interpreter: Reads code line by line.

    Compiler: Reads whole file at a time...
