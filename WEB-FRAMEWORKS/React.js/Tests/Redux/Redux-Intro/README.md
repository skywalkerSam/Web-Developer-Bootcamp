# [Introduction to Redux](https://fireship.io/courses/react/basics-redux/)

Decentralized states are hard to test and scale. Enter a world of predictable and centralized state management for JavaScript applications.

[Redux Documentation](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)

- Redux is not always necessary, and can be overkill for smaller applications.

## Redux Installation

```shell
npm install redux react-redux
```

## Redux Toolkit Installation

```shell
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

## Core Features

- **Centralized**: All your state is stored in one place.
- **Predictable**: Redux follows strict rules that makes your state predictable.
- **Flexible**: Works with any UI layer, including React, Angular, or Vue.
- **Easy Debugging**: Redux makes it easy to track changes and bugs.
- **DevTools**: Includes hot reloading, action log, and state snapshots.

`NOTE`: The most loved and hated library in the React ecosystem... lol ;)

## Until next time...
